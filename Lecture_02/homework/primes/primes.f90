! Test against the sequence of prime numbers:
!
!   https://oeis.org/A000040
!
! First implementation: just two nested loops: over numbers and over divisors up
! to sqrt(n).
!
! Second implementation: do the sieve of Eratosthenes.
! 1) Create an array of natural numbers from 2 to n to contain primes and zeros.
! 2) Start from multiple p = 1.
! 3) Repeat until p doesn't exceed n.  Increment p.  If primes(p) is not marked, then
! 3) Mark all multiples of p in primes from p^2 to n with a step of p.
! 4) Repeat step 3).
! It's faster to start marking from p^2 and not 2p because by marking all
! mutliples we already eliminate all of them before p^2.
!
! Generate a sequence of integers from 2 through n.
! Let p be the current prime number.  Start with p = 2.
! Mark the multiples of p in the sequence from 2p, 3p, ..., n (don't mark p itself).
! Find the smallest number in the sequence greater than p that is not marked.
! If there was no such number, stop.
! Otherwise, this is the next prime.  Set p to it and repeat marking again.
! Once done, all unmarked numbers in the sequence are primes.
