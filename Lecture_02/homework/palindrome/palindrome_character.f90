! This solution using a character type
! a) is easier as no counting and parsing of digits is needed;
! b) requires you to know character substrings and intrinsic functions for the
!    character type.
! c) uses a static (fixed-length) character string for simplicity.  If you want
!    to use a dynamic (variable-length) string, you must deallocate it at the
!    end and you must read it in carefully.
